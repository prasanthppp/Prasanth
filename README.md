<p> ## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Jntua cea Anthapuram with a strong interest in VLSI Design and Embedded Systems. I'm passionate about blending hardware and software to build smart, efficient systems that solve real-world problems.

I'm currently learning and growing in the world of hardware development 
This GitHub is a space where I explore, experiment, and improve step by step.  
Feel free to check out my progress or share tips with me!
